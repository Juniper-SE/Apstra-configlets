# Configlets & Property Sets

Apstra automates the creation and management of Leaf/Spine IP Fabrics. Apstra derives a validated configuration as part of the Intent based abstraction model which addresses the large part of the VXLAN EVPN reference design. For any configuration that lives outside of the Apstra reference design, a feature known as a ‘Configlet’ can be used. A configlet allows the administrator to create configuration templates and have them automatically deployed to devices based on the Intent. The configlet management system is designed to support multiple vendor and syntax types.

The Configlet can be married with the Proprty set
